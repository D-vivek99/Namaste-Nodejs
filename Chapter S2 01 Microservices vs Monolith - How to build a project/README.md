# Microservices vs Monolith - How to build a project

## Software Project Development in the Industry

### Waterfall Model Overview
The Waterfall Model is a sequential software development process that consists of a series of steps. Each step must be completed before moving on to the next. This model is one of the traditional approaches used in the software industry for project development.

### Steps in the Waterfall Model

1. **Requirement**
   - Gather and analyze all project requirements.
   - Document the functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Stakeholders provide input to ensure a clear understanding of the project's needs.
   - **Roles Involved**: Business Analysts, Project Managers, Stakeholders, Product Owners

2. **Design**
   - Create a system and software design based on the requirements.
   - Architectural design: High-level system structure.
   - Detailed design: Specifies how each component will work.
   - **Roles Involved**: Solution Architects, UX/UI Designers, System Designers, Technical Leads

3. **Development**
   - Actual coding of the software begins based on the design documents.
   - Development teams implement functionalities and integrate different modules.
   - **Roles Involved**: Software Developers, Backend/Frontend Developers, Database Administrators, DevOps Engineers

4. **Testing**
   - Perform testing to identify defects and bugs.
   - Different testing methods include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
   - **Roles Involved**: Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, Testers, Test Leads, Automation Engineers

5. **Deployment**
   - Once testing is successful, the software is deployed to a live environment.
   - The deployment phase includes user training and system configuration.
   - **Roles Involved**: DevOps Engineers, System Administrators, Release Managers, IT Support

6. **Maintenance**
   - Ongoing support for the software post-deployment.
   - Fixing any issues that arise and implementing necessary updates or enhancements.
   - **Roles Involved**: Support Engineers, Maintenance Team, Developers, IT Support, Customer Support
