## 📌 Overview  
DevTinder is a **MERN stack** web application designed to help developers **connect and collaborate**, similar to Tinder but for the tech community.  

This repository contains the **frontend** of DevTinder, built with **React + Vite** for fast development and optimized performance. It uses **Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI** for a modern and responsive UI, while **React Router DOM** handles navigation between pages.  

Currently, the frontend is in the **development phase**, with foundational setup and UI components being built.

## ✅ Steps Completed  

### **1️⃣ Configuring Vite + React**  
- Initialized the **React project using Vite**, which provides faster development builds and improved performance compared to Create React App.  
- Verified the project structure and ensured Vite is correctly configured for smooth development.  

### **2️⃣ Code Cleanup & Initial Testing**  
- Removed unnecessary boilerplate code generated by Vite.  
- Conducted a basic **test run** to confirm that the development server is working correctly and all dependencies are properly installed.  

### **3️⃣ Installing & Configuring Tailwind CSS (v3)**  
- Installed **Tailwind CSS v3**, which is a utility-first CSS framework for efficient styling.  
- Configured Tailwind by modifying the **`tailwind.config.js`** and added it to the project’s **CSS files**.  
- Successfully tested Tailwind classes to ensure proper integration.  

### **4️⃣ Installing & Configuring Daisy UI**  
- Installed **Daisy UI**, a Tailwind CSS component library, to speed up UI development with pre-designed, customizable components.  
- Configured Daisy UI in the **Tailwind setup** to make its components available across the project.  
- Tested Daisy UI components to verify proper rendering and styling.  

### **5️⃣ Creating `Navbar.jsx`**  
- Designed a **responsive navigation bar** using Daisy UI components.  
- Ensured that the Navbar includes essential elements like **logo, navigation links, and styling for mobile and desktop views**.  
- Used React state (if needed) for **handling dropdown menus or mobile navigation**.  

### **6️⃣ Installing & Testing React Router DOM**  
- Installed **React Router DOM** to manage client-side routing.  
- Created a **basic routing structure**, including pages like Home, Profile, and Feed.  
- Tested navigation using React Router to ensure smooth transitions between pages.

## 🎯 Next Steps  

- **Authentication Pages**: Start building **Login & Signup** pages to allow user authentication.  
- **Homepage & Feed UI**: Design and structure the main **Feed Page**, where users can explore developer profiles.  
- **Theme & Responsiveness Improvements**: Enhance the UI design using Tailwind and Daisy UI for a **more polished and user-friendly experience**.  
- **Integrate Backend APIs**: Connect the frontend with the **DevTinder Backend** for authentication and user interactions.  

---

## 🔥 Conclusion  
The **DevTinder Frontend** setup is now complete, with all core configurations in place. The development process will now focus on building **authentication, user profiles, and the main feed interface**.  

With **Vite for speed, Tailwind for styling, Daisy UI for components, and React Router for navigation**, the foundation for an **efficient, scalable, and modern UI** is set. 🚀
